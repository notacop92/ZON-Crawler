# ZON-Crawler
Zeit Online Webcrawler in Python using BS4 and Requests

Hey Guys. Here are my first humble coding attempts. 

The crawler creates a dict nested in a list. And the data is saved in a .csv (delimiter = ';') for the readability in MS Excel.

Next steps should be:

- Writting a scheduler which activates twice a day or maybe every 4h
- Preventing clones in the Data
- Finding out how to evalute the Data
